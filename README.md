# World_Weather_Analysis

## Overview

This project focused on developing features of the PlanMyTrip app to assist customers with identifying ideal travel destinations, finding nearby hotel information and creating a travel itinerary.

The initial part of this analysis generated a list of over 500 random cities across the world in order to collect weather data. The data was used to create a series of scatter plots showing the relationship between latitude and various weather parameters (humidity, cloudiness, maximum temperature and wind speed).
Further analysis was done in the form of statistical calculations, to show the correlation of certain weather parameters vs the Northern and Southern hemispheres. This was done to help PlanMyTrip with predicting the best time of year for people to plan their vacation.

Using the weather data collected, the cities were then mapped based on certain weather criteria set by the customer. Multiple heatmaps were generated using the weather parameters from the dataset.

Code was written to create a feature on the app that allows customers to search for travel locations based on temperature preferences. 

With the preferred travel locations, we then created a heatmap with markers identifying max temp, city location information and the name of a nearby hotel. 

A weather description feature was added to the app to enhance it per the recommendation of beta testers. Along with this, code was added to allow the customer to create a travel itinerary for their preferred locations. This is displayed on a map with markers outlining location information, weather description and a nearby hotel.
